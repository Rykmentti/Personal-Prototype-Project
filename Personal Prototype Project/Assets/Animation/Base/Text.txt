Copy paste this with CTRL+D anywhere you want and then add sprites and animations to their respected animations. Use these only as base, ie. this folders animation files for humanoid animations.

Do NOT copy paste outside editor, because GUID associated with the files is brought with copies made outside of editor and Unity throws a fit.

Use CTRL+D to make a clone of files and then move them to their respected places/folders and then rename them whatever you want, those files will have nothing to do with the original files.
